# Room Occupancy Estimation
This dataset is related to room occupancy estimation. The goal is to estimate the precise number of occupants in a room using multiple non-intrusive environmental sensors like temperature, light, sound, CO2, and PIR. This was made as part of a project for an introductory Data Science Course. 

The dataset comes from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/864/room+occupancy+estimation
## Setup Instructions
The repository has the Jupyter Notebook `IDS_Project.ipynb`, as well as the dataset fot this project `OccupancyEstimation.csv`. This project runs flawlessly on Google Colab with the following instructions and similar instructions may be used to run it elsewhere
### Instructions
  1. Open `IDS_Project.ipynb`.
  2. Replace the value assigned to the variable `PATH` with the file path of `OccupancyEstimation.csv`.

And voila, you can run and test the project for yourself!
